🎯 Evaluation Function
The engine evaluates the position based on:

Material advantage.
Control of the center.
Mobility (number of legal moves).
Checkmate and stalemate detection.
🏆 Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning
The engine searches up to a depth of 3.
Alpha-Beta pruning reduces the number of nodes evaluated.
The engine calculates the best move based on the highest evaluation score for White and lowest for Black.

 Add castling support.
