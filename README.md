# â™” Chess Engine
A Python-based chess engine that uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to calculate the best moves. The engine evaluates board positions based on piece values, positional advantages, and checkmate scenarios. This project includes move generation, check/checkmate detection, and an evaluation function.
